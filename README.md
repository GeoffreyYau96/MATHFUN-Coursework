Functional Programming Assignment

"Your task is to write a program in Haskell for a film ratings website that lets users add films
and display the details of various films. Users may also rate any film by saying they ‘like’
or ‘dislike’ it. A film’s ‘web-site rating’ is the percentage of its user ratings that are ‘likes’,
rounded to the nearest whole number (for example, if a film has two likes and one dislike,
its website rating is 67%). A film cannot have more than one rating from each user, but
users can change their minds, for example, to like a film that they previously disliked. The
site maintains a “database” (a textfile) of many films; each record of which gives a film’s
title, the director, the year of release, a list of users who like the film, and a list of users who
dislike the film."
